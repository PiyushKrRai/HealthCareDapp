# HealthChain: A Decentralized Health Record System

## Project Description

HealthChain is a decentralized application (DApp) designed to revolutionize how medical records are stored, managed, and shared. Built on the **CoreDAO blockchain**, this system shifts the paradigm of data ownership from centralized institutions to the individual patient.

The core of the system utilizes a smart contract to manage permissions and ownership, acting as an immutable access control layer. The actual, sensitive health record files are encrypted and stored on a decentralized storage network like **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**. The on-chain contract only stores the reference hash to this data, ensuring privacy, security, and cost-efficiency. This hybrid approach leverages the best of both worlds: CoreDAO's robust security for managing who can see what, and IPFS for scalable, decentralized data storage.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to create a globally accessible, patient-centric healthcare ecosystem where every individual has absolute sovereignty over their medical history. We aim to dismantle the data silos that currently exist between hospitals, clinics, and countries, fostering a new standard of interoperability and data portability.

By empowering patients with direct control, we envision a future with:
*   **Reduced medical errors** caused by incomplete patient histories.
*   **Seamless experiences** when changing healthcare providers.
*   **Accelerated medical research** through opt-in, anonymized data sharing.
*   **Enhanced trust and transparency** between patients and providers.

## Future Scope

The initial smart contract serves as the foundational layer for a much broader platform. The future scope of HealthChain is to build a comprehensive suite of tools and services around this core protocol, making decentralized health management intuitive and powerful for patients, providers, and researchers.

### Key Features
*   **Patient-Controlled Access:** Patients have the ultimate authority to grant and revoke access to their records for any provider with a single transaction. All access history is transparent and auditable on the blockchain.

*   **Immutable Record History:** Every new record added by a verified provider creates a permanent, unchangeable log, ensuring the integrity of a patient's entire medical history.

*   **Provider Verification Protocol:** A governance model (potentially a DAO) will be established to verify the credentials of healthcare providers, ensuring that only legitimate and trusted entities can join the network and add records.

*   **Emergency Access Mechanism:** A "break-glass" feature that allows temporary, time-limited access to a patient's records in critical, life-threatening situations. This action would be heavily audited and would immediately notify the patient.

*   **Anonymous Data Pooling for Research:** An opt-in system where patients can choose to contribute their anonymized data to research pools. They could be rewarded with tokens for their contribution, creating a new incentive model for advancing medical science.

*   **Insurance and Pharmacy Integration:** Developing modules that allow for secure, programmatic interactions with insurance companies for automated claims processing and with pharmacies for verifying and dispensing prescriptions directly from the DApp.
